# This is an Atmel START project, with many, many, many generated and boilerplate files that we do not wish to store in the git repository.

# Ignore all these in a way that allows us to use "!" rules on the files we do
# need. Unfortunately, if we used * more aggressively then "!" would not work.
.vs/
*.atsln
*/*.xml
*/*.cproj
*/*.h
*/*.c
# This rule excludes toolchain outputs (i.e everything in Debug/ and Release/)
*/*/*

# Keep these files
!*/*.c
!*/*.h
!*/.atmelstart/atmel_start_config.atstart
!.gitignore

# But definitely ignore these files
atmel_start.h
atmel_start.c
